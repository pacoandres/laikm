# Linux amdgpu issues kernel/mesa
## The project
This isn't a real project. It's just a try for using Github issues functionallity as a tidy storage for test results on the different approaches to solve the issue discussed in [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798). Just a try to make testing work a little more productive.

These issues are related to the Linux kernel and Mesa drivers when using AMD's gfx8 and gfx9 (and may be more) families GPUs, kernel 6.12+ and mesa 24.3.

If you have any of this GPUs and have suffered some freezes you can contribute testing the solutions posted in [issues](https://github.com/pacoandres/laikm/issues) (or in [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798) and posting your results in the same issue/thread.

When a solution is proved to fail the issue where marked 'close', so no one has to test it again.

## Collaborating
The idea is that everyone who wants to help in the search for the solution will be added as collaborator in this "project". If you post any result I'll be asked for being added as a collaborator.

## PATCHES
You can downloan the patches applied on each release at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M9ny4knvj0gZ5yh6xVZwF9WwMhsA3OJj](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M9ny4knvj0gZ5yh6xVZwF9WwMhsA3OJj).
