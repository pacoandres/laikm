# Linux amdgpu issues kernel/mesa

This isn't a real project. It's just a try for using Github as a tidy storage for test results on the different approaches to solve the issue discussed in [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798). Just a try to make testing work a little more productive.

These issues are related to the Linux kernel and Mesa drivers when using AMD's gfx8 and gfx9 (and may be more) families GPUs, kernel 6.12 and mesa 24.3.

If you have any of this GPUs and have suffered some freezes you can contribute testing the solutions posted in [issues](https://github.com/pacoandres/laikm/issues) (or in [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=301798) and posting your results in the same issue/thread.

When a solution is proved to fail the issue where marked 'close', so no one has to test it again.
